            7 out of 10 fatal general aviation accidents in the United States
            can be prevented with advanced automation systems. We are building
            technology that will make aviation safer and will save lives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our system enables continuous autopilot engagement through all
            phases of flight, including auto-taxi, auto-takeoff and
            auto-landing. This automation will reduce the occurrence of common
            causes of fatal aviation accidents, such as controlled flight into
            terrain and loss of control.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rural communities are struggling to maintain commercial air service,
            with more than 300 seeing reduced or eliminated service since 2019.
            Automation will fundamentally transform the way goods and people
            move around the planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            Starting with a certification-forward approach, Reliable Robotics
            first demonstrated gate-to-gate fully automated operation of
            regional cargo aircraft and is now working towards commercialization
            of technologies for Part 23 cargo and Part 25 passenger vehicles.

            Robert’s engineering experience spans aerospace, self-driving cars,
            robotics, gaming and consumer products. Prior to co-founding
            Reliable Robotics, he was the Director of Flight Software at SpaceX
            where he led the development of the onboard flight software for the
            Falcon 9 rocket and the Dragon spacecraft, resulting in the first
            commercial mission to the International Space Station. At Tesla, as
            Senior Director of Autopilot, Robert brought to market the first
            consumer automobile with fully unassisted self-driving capability.
            At X (Google’s skunkworks division), Robert led a team bringing
            advanced machine perception and manipulation technologies to large
            vehicles. Earlier in his career, he developed three Game of the Year
            award-winning titles as a Game Engine Programmer at Sony
            PlayStation. Robert holds a B.S. in Computer Science, a B.S. in
            Computer Engineering, and an M.S. in Electrical and Computer
            Engineering from Oregon State University.

            Juerg has extensive engineering and leadership experience designing
            and building safety critical systems primarily in aerospace. Prior
            to co-founding Reliable Robotics, Juerg led the Compute and Avionics
            Platforms Development team at SpaceX. He led a team of engineers and
            designers building the core avionics systems that powered the Falcon
            9 and Dragon spacecraft. His work on the Crew Dragon vehicle was
            vital to bringing U.S. astronauts back to the International Space
            Station. At Aveox Inc., he developed power electronics and embedded
            systems controllers for commercial aircraft including the Boeing 787
            and Airbus A380. He also designed and built multiple highly reliable
            and efficient platforms for applications in industrial automation,
            surgical devices and unmanned military systems. Juerg earned a B.S.
            in Electrical Engineering with a Specialization in Software
            Engineering and Embedded Systems from Winterthur Polytechnic School
            of Engineering in Switzerland. Prior to that, he completed an
            Electronics apprenticeship from MSW Winterthur.
